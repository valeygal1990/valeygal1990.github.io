	<!-- 
		Hi Valentine!  I added feedback to your final so far in HTML comments like this one.

		This is a good start so far.  I would like to see the page a bit more fleshed out.
		Also, I would encourage you to properly indent your HTML, so that child tags are indented inside 
		their parent tags.  It makes the HTML a whole lot easier to read.  For example:

		<html>
			<head>
				<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
			</head>

			<body>
				<header>
					<h1>Hello!</h1>
				</header>

				<main>
					<p>Something goes here.</p>
				</main>
			</body>
		</html>

		More comments below!

					I see that this <section> tag has  "row" class from Bootstrap.  Are you also planning to 
					add col- classes to the forms inside the section?

					Take a look at the "Grid Options" section here:
					http://getbootstrap.com/css/

					Also, I noticed that each form field/section is in its own <form> tag.  If this entire
					page is one whole form, all of the fields should be inside a single <form> tag.  The form
					can contain <section> tags inside of it - for example to visually separate the different
					parts of the form - but all of these fields, including the submit button, needs to be in a single
					<form> tag.  For example:

					<form id="myForm">
						<section id="caregiversName">
							<label for="caregiversName"> Caregiver Name</label>
							<input type="text" name="caregiversName" value="caregiversName">
						</section>

						<section id="childsName">
							<label for="childsName">Child's Name</label>
							<input type="Text" name="childsName" value="childsName">
						</section>

						<section id="actions">
							<button id="backButton"><</button>
							<button id="submitLog">Submit Log</button>
							<button id="nextButton">></button>
						</section>
					</form>
				-->
				<section class=" topSection row fluidSpanSection">
				<form id = "caregiversName">
					<label for = "caregiversName"> Caregiver Name</label>
					<input type = "text" name = "caregiversName" value = "caregiversName">
				</form>
				
				<form id = "todaysDate">
					<label for = "todaysDate">Today's Date</label>
					<input type = "date" name = "todaysDate" value = "todaysDate"> 
				<!--
					I'm sure this is a typo, but this end </h2> tag should be an end </form> tag.

					<!--
						Make sure to give this <select> form field a name (just like you do with <input>).

						Also, there needs to be text between the start <option> tag and the end <option> tag.  This 
						text is what appears in the drop down menu itself.  For example:

						<option value="Arrival">Arrival</option>
					-->
					<select>
						<option value = "Arrival"></option>
						<option value = "Meal"></option>
						<option value = "Nap"></option>
						<option value = "Playdate"></option>
						<option value = "Appointment"></option>
						<option value = "Other"></option>

					I'm sure this is a typo, but your <section> tag is missing the end pointy bracket; 
					I added it in here.

		<!-- put childs name into its own section
		time should be in its own section
		activity should be in its own section
		these three sections should float side by side
		notes for the day should be its own section on the bottom right of the page
		there should be a border around each section
		The sections for time, activity and duration are going to be tables
